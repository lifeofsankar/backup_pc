# ==========================================
# PILZ CARTESIAN LIMITS
#
# For straight-line (cartesian) motions
# Example: moving tool in straight line to pick object
#
# trans = translation (moving in X,Y,Z)
# rot = rotation (roll, pitch, yaw)
# ==========================================

cartesian_limits:
  max_trans_vel: 1.0      # 1 m/s max linear speed
  max_trans_acc: 2.25     # smooth linear acceleration
  max_trans_dec: -5.0     # can brake faster than accelerate
  max_rot_vel: 1.57       # 90°/s max rotation speed
```

**Key concept:**
```
Joint space planning:
- Moves joints directly
- Path curves through space
- Faster

Cartesian planning:
- Tool moves in straight line
- More intuitive for pick/place
- Slower but precise
