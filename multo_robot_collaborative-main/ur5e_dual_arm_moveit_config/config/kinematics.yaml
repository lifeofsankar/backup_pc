# ==========================================
# KINEMATICS SOLVERS
#
# IK = Inverse Kinematics
# Problem: Given end effector pose (x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw)
#          Find joint angles that achieve it
#
# Solvers available:
# - KDLKinematicsPlugin: Fast, analytical
# - TracIK: More robust, handles difficult poses
# - TRAC-IK: Even better success rate
#
# Parameters:
# - kinematics_solver_search_resolution: accuracy (smaller = more accurate)
# - kinematics_solver_timeout: give up after X seconds
# - kinematics_solver_attempts: retry N times
